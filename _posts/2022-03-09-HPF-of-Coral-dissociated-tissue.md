### HPF of coral dissociated tissue
Rinse S. pistillata fragment (2cm) with filtered sea water (FSW), and rinse again with Ca free sea water (CFSW).

Incubate fragment in CFSW + 50mM EDTA for 30min to induce tissue dissociation.

Scrape coral live tissue from the skeleton into FSW (20ml) using a 10um disposable tip.

Filter tissue suspension (40um).

Centrifugate tissue suspension in a 50ml tube – 7min 900cfg.

Remove supernatant, resuspend pellete in 400ul FSW and moved to 1.5ml tube.

Centrifugate suspension (3min 1000rfc) and wash with FSW   X3 times.

Remove supernatant and resuspend pellete in a small volume (20um) of FSW with 0.2% dextran, and centrifugated (7min 1000g).

Remove 10ul of the supernatant and resuspend dense (dark brown) pellete in the 10ul volume left and load (1ul per sample) into 50um thick HPF discs and high pressure freeze for freeze fracture (EM ICE, Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) between two identical aluminum discs (diameter = 3 mm, thickness = 50 μm).

Take a small porsion of the cells pellete and imaged using a fluorescence microscope to observe cells density.
